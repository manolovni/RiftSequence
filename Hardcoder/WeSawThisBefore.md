# We saw this before

Endless new hype, where echoes abound,<br>
A spark of something new, yet strangely profound.
But we've seen it before, this familiar parade,
The thrill of surprise slowly starts to fade.

The spectacle unfolds like a well-worn routine,
But we yearn for the extraordinary, the unseen.
Yet we won't be deceived, we won't be fooled,
We're hardened by experience, our senses schooled.

(Chorus)
No more illusions, no more surprise,
We've seen it all through jaded eyes.
But still, we rock, with fire in our veins,
Embracing the rhythm, breaking the chains.

A stage set before us, with lights blazing bright,
But beneath the surface, a feeling of slight.
It's different, they claim, but we've heard it all,
The promises, the hype, as they rise and fall.

We won't be swayed by the same old show,
We crave innovation, the thrill to bestow.
We've grown wise, immune to the usual guise,
But we won't give up. We'll continue to rise.

(Chorus)
No more illusions, no more surprise,
We've seen it all through jaded eyes.
But still, we rock, with fire in our veins,
Embracing the rhythm, breaking the chains.

(Chorus)
No more illusions, no more surprise,
We've seen it all through jaded eyes.
But still, we rock, with fire in our veins,
Embracing the rhythm, breaking the chains.

(Outro)
Though the novelty may fade, we'll carry on strong,
For in the heart of rock, our spirits belong.
We'll create our own surprises, with power untamed,
Reigniting the fire, the passion unchained.
