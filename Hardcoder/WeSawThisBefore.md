# We saw this before

Endless new hype, where echoes abound,<br>
A spark of something new, yet strangely profound.<br>
But we've seen it before, this familiar parade,<br>
The thrill of surprise slowly starts to fade.<br>

The spectacle unfolds like a well-worn routine,<br>
But we yearn for the extraordinary, the unseen.<br>
Yet we won't be deceived, we won't be fooled,<br>
We're hardened by experience, our senses schooled.<br>

(Chorus)<br>
No more illusions, no more surprise,<br>
We've seen it all through jaded eyes.<br>
But still, we rock, with fire in our veins,<br>
Embracing the rhythm, breaking the chains.<br>

A stage set before us, with lights blazing bright,<br>
But beneath the surface, a feeling of slight.<br>
It's different, they claim, but we've heard it all,<br>
The promises, the hype, as they rise and fall.<br>

We won't be swayed by the same old show,<br>
We crave innovation, the thrill to bestow.<br>
We've grown wise, immune to the usual guise,<br>
But we won't give up. We'll continue to rise.<br>

(Chorus)<br>
No more illusions, no more surprise,<br>
We've seen it all through jaded eyes.<br>
But still, we rock, with fire in our veins,<br>
Embracing the rhythm, breaking the chains.<br>

(Bridge)<br>
Guitar Solo<br>

(Chorus)<br>
No more illusions, no more surprise,<br>
We've seen it all through jaded eyes.<br>
But still, we rock, with fire in our veins,<br>
Embracing the rhythm, breaking the chains.<br>

(Outro)<br>
Though the novelty may fade, we'll carry on strong,<br>
For in the heart of rock, our spirits belong.<br>
We'll create our own surprises, with power untamed,<br>
Reigniting the fire, the passion unchained.<br>
