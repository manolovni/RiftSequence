# Hardcoder

I'm a coding machine, typing lines all-day
My fingers never stop, I don't need no break
I'm a master of syntax, my code is clean
I'm a programmer, the best you've ever seen

I fly with no effort, the rig is my stud
My codeâ€™s optimized, it runs like a drug
I'm a hacker at heart, I break through the walls
My code is my weapon, I conquer it all

Chorus:
I'm a hardcore coder, I don't mess around
My code is bulletproof, it never goes down
I'm a programming god, I rule the machine
I'm a hardcore coder, the ultimate dream

I live for the challenge, I thrive on the code
I'm a programming beast, It never gets old
I'm a master of logic, I solve every task
I'm a hardcore coder, my stuff built to last

Chorus:
I'm a hardcore coder, I don't mess around
My code is bulletproof, it never goes down
I'm a hardcore coder, the ultimate dream

I'm a programming god, I rule the machine x 4
I'm a programming god x 4


Chorus:
I'm a hardcore coder, I don't mess around
My code is bulletproof, it never goes down
I'm a programming god, I rule the machine
I'm a hardcore coder, the ultimate dream

Outro:
I'm a hardcore coder, I'm in control
My code is my power, it's part of my soul
I'm a programming legend, I'm the real deal
I'm a hardcore coder, and I am always here!
