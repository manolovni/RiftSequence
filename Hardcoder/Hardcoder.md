# Hardcoder

I'm a coding machine, typing lines all-day <br>
My fingers never stop, I don't need no break <br>
I'm a master of syntax, my code is clean <br>
I'm a programmer, the best you've ever seen <br>

I fly with no effort, the rig is my stud <br>
My codeâ€™s optimized, it runs like a drug <br>
I'm a hacker at heart, I break through the walls <br>
My code is my weapon, I conquer it all <br> 

Chorus: <br>
I'm a hardcore coder, I don't mess around <br>
My code is bulletproof, it never goes down <br>
I'm a programming god, I rule the machine <br>
I'm a hardcore coder, the ultimate dream <br>

I live for the challenge, I thrive on the code <br>
I'm a programming beast, It never gets old <br>
I'm a master of logic, I solve every task <br>
I'm a hardcore coder, my stuff built to last <br>

I'm a coding machine, typing lines all-day <br>
My fingers never stop, I don't need no break <br>
I'm a master of syntax, my code is clean <br>
I'm a programmer, the best you've ever seen <br>

Chorus: <br>
I'm a hardcore coder, I don't mess around <br>
My code is bulletproof, it never goes down <br>
I'm a programming god, I rule the machine <br>
I'm a hardcore coder, the ultimate dream <br>

(Guitar Solo) <br>

I'm a programming god, I rule the machine x 4 <br>
I'm a programming god x 4 <br>

Chorus: <br>
I'm a hardcore coder, I don't mess around <br>
My code is bulletproof, it never goes down <br>
I'm a programming god, I rule the machine <br>
I'm a hardcore coder, the ultimate dream <br>

Outro: <br>
I'm a hardcore coder, I'm in control <br>
My code is my power, it's part of my soul <br>
I'm a programming legend, I'm the real deal <br>
I'm a hardcore coder, and I am always here! <br>
