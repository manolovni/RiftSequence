# Glitchy Muse

(Intro) <br>
In a digital world where glitches unfold, <br>
A developer's heart was about to be sold. <br>
He met a girl, a coding muse so rare, <br>
Her glitches and quirks, a love he couldn't bear. <br>

Lines of code, they intertwined, <br>
He couldn't escape, love's grip so kind. <br>
But her glitches, oh, they tested his will, <br>
A bittersweet melody, his heart's overkill. <br>

(Chorus) <br>
She's a glitchy love, driving me insane, <br>
Her pixels dance, but true love remains. <br>
Through the crashes and bugs, we'll rise above, <br>
A developer's heart, entangled in love. <br>

With each line he wrote, her glitches played their part, <br>
But her smile, her laughter, mended his broken heart. <br>
He debugged her soul, line by line, day and night, <br>
For in her imperfections, he found love's purest light. <br>

His patience waned, his frustration grew, <br>
But her glitches, like fireworks, lit up his view. <br>
Through error messages and endless loops, <br>
He'd rewrite their story, for their love he'd recoup. <br>

(Chorus) <br>
She's a glitchy love, driving me insane, <br>
Her pixels dance, but true love remains. <br>
Through the crashes and bugs, we'll rise above, <br>
A developer's heart, entangled in love. <br>

(Bridge)
In a world of algorithms and binary code, <br>
Their love defied logic, a tale yet untold. <br>
Through the lines of syntax, he sought a solution, <br>
To mend her broken fragments, love's sweet restitution. <br>

(Guitar Solo) <br>

In a final showdown, he fixed her crashing heart, <br>
Combining lines of love, a brand-new start. <br>
Her glitches, once frustrating, became a symphony, <br>
For in their flawed perfection, their love found harmony. <br>

He'll rewrite her code, mend her errors no more, <br>
Their love, an adventure, worth fighting for. <br>
In the binary realm, their souls aligned, <br>
He'll be her dev, and she, his love defined. <br>

(Chorus) <br>
She's a glitchy love, driving me insane, <br>
Her pixels dance, but true love remains. <br>
Through the crashes and bugs, we've risen above, <br>
A developer's heart, entangled in love. <br>
