# Backup

Late night, cold sweat, data's going down, <br>
Fingers on the keys, heart begins to pound. <br>
Database fading, like a ghost in the machine, <br>
Backup should save us, that's the routine. <br>

(Chorus) <br>
But the hard drive's screaming, no mercy in its song, <br>
Our last line of defense, but the backup was all wrong. <br>
All hopes are crushed, no salvation to be found, <br>
In the realm of bits and bytes, we're helplessly bound. <br>

Code whispers in the void, despair in every line, <br>
Lost in the digital, where the sun doesn't shine. <br>
Grit on our faces, shadows in our eyes, <br>
The backup was our promise, now it's where our hope dies. <br>

The backup's broken, we're dancing on the edge, <br>
Our fortress has crumbled, no line of defense to pledge. <br>
All hopes are crushed, the screen's cold, no rebound, <br>
In the digital wasteland, our tears are the only sound. <br>

(Chorus) <br>
The failure of the backup x 4 <br>

The servers were our guardians, the backup, our savior, <br>
But the system's betrayed us, no favors to favor. <br>
Falling in the abyss, no lifeline left, <br>
With the failure of the backup, we're victims of theft. <br>

The backup's silent, no echoes in the hall, <br>
The last line of defense, now we're set for the fall. <br>
All hopes are crushed, the error's profound, <br>
In the ashes of the database, no recovery is found. <br>

(Outro) <br>
Stranded in the silence, staring at the screen, <br>
In the tale of the failed backup, we're the lost and the unseen. <br>
The data's gone, the backup's lost, the story's been told, <br>
In the hard rock ballad of the data that's been sold. <br>

(Chorus) <br>
The failure of the backup <br>
That's been sold <br>
The failure of the backup <br>
That's been sold <br>
The failure of the backup <br>
That's been sold <br>
The failure of the backup <br>

(Guitar Solo) <br>
