# Dead Lines

In the realm of code, where lines intertwine, <br>
A quest for perfection, a mission divine. <br>
With keystrokes like thunder, we dance on the keys, <br>
Crafting our creations, dreams boundless as seas. <br>

But the world outside beckons, with its deadlines and strife, <br>
Reality crashing, disrupting our life. <br>
Management's hammer pounds on our door, <br>
Demands for results, they won't take no more. <br>

(Chorus) <br>
Code warriors, we strive for perfection, <br>
But the world won't wait for our introspection. <br>
Money and deadlines, they hold us tight, <br>
We can't reach the heights we dream in the night. <br>

Lines of brilliance, algorithms supreme, <br>
Yet time slips away like a fleeting dream. <br>
Burning the midnight oil, battling the fray, <br>
But the demands of the world won't simply obey. <br>

The clock keeps on ticking, relentless and cruel, <br>
The deadlines approach, our dreams start to fuel. <br>
Management's whip cracks, the pressure builds high, <br>
Our quest for perfection begins to slowly die. <br>

(Chorus) <br>
Code warriors, we strive for perfection, <br>
But the world won't wait for our introspection. <br>
Money and deadlines, they hold us tight, <br>
We can't reach the heights we dream in the night. <br>

(Guitar Solo) <br>

(Bridge) <br>
We yearn for the elegance, the flawless design, <br>
But reality's grip won't release its bind. <br>
The weight of the world, it crushes our dreams, <br>
As we surrender to deadlines, it rips at the seams. <br>

(Chorus) <br>
Code warriors, we strive for perfection, <br>
But the world won't wait for our introspection. <br>
Money and deadlines, they hold us tight, <br>
We can't reach the heights we dream in the night. <br>

So we march on, in this battle we fight, <br>
Balancing passion and writing dead lines. <br>
Though perfection eludes us, we never give in, <br>
For in the pursuit of greatness, our spirits shall win. <br>
