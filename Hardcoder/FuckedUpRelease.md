# Fucked up release

All chaos unfolds, dreams collide, <br>
A release gone awry, an uphill ride. <br>
We poured our souls into this creation, <br>
But now we're faced with devastation. <br>

The code misfires, the system's ablaze, <br>
Everything we built, now a haunting maze. <br>
But we won't back down, we'll fight the fight, <br>
For failure won't define us, we'll make it right. <br>

(Chorus) <br>
Through the wreckage we rise, determination in our eyes, <br>
Though the release has crumbled, we won't compromise. <br>
We'll fix what's broken, we'll mend the fray, <br>
The fire within us won't fade away. <br>

Lines of code entangled in a web, <br>
As the aftermath, the road ahead. <br>
The back-up failed, the systems collapsed, <br>
But our spirits stay strong, our resilience tapped. <br>

We wear the scars, the battle wounds deep, <br>
Yet our determination, it won't retreat. <br>
With every bug we fix, we'll rise again, <br>
In the face of adversity, we'll transcend. <br>

(Chorus) <br>
Through the wreckage we rise, determination in our eyes, <br>
Though the release has crumbled, we won't compromise. <br>
We'll fix what's broken, we'll mend the fray, <br>
The fire within us won't fade away. <br>

Through the wreckage we rise, determination in our eyes, <br>
Though the release has crumbled, we won't compromise. <br>
We'll fix what's broken, we'll mend the fray, <br>
The fire within us won't fade away. <br>

In the face of defeat, we find our might, <br>
As developers united, we'll make it right. <br>
With every line of code, we'll resurrect, <br>
For failure won't define us, we won't accept. <br>
We'll rise from the ashes, stronger than before, <br>
In this fucked up release, our passion will endure. <br>
