# Hotfix

(Intro) <br>
It's a gamble, every single time, <br>
Walking on the edge, between chaos and prime. <br>
But that’s the life, in the tech world today, <br>
Hot fixes coming, come what may. <br>

Woke up this morning, systems on the blink, <br>
Sweat on my brow, don’t have time to think. <br>
A problem’s arising, the code’s got a glitch, <br>
A hot fix is needed, that son of a bitch. <br>

(Pre-Chorus) <br>
Everybody wants it, it’s the talk of the show, <br>
But deep in their hearts, there's a fear that grows. <br>

(Chorus) <br>
Hot fix x 4 <br>
Push, push, push, push, push, push, push it. <br>

Deadline’s looming, the boss is on the prowl, <br>
"We need that fix, and we need it now!" <br>
Code’s being written, fingers typing fast, <br>
Everybody praying, hoping it will last. <br>

(Pre-Chorus) <br>
Everybody’s on edge, feeling the heat, <br>
Hot fix coming, can't skip a beat. <br>

(Chorus) <br>
Hot fix x 4 <br>
Push, push, push, push, push, push, push it x 3 <br>

(Bridge) <br>
Server’s are waiting, the moment is here, <br>
Silence in the room, cut by the fear. <br>
Eyes on the screen, as the code goes live, <br>
Everybody’s hoping, the system survives. <br>

(Pre-Chorus) <br>
Everybody’s brave, though the stakes are high, <br>
Pushing it live, under the sky. <br>

(Chorus) <br>
Hot fix x 8 <br>
Push, push, push, push, push, push, push it x 3 <br>

(Guitar Solo) <br>

(Outro) <br>
Hotfix, it's a risky game, <br>
Some get the glory, some get the blame. <br>
But in the end, it’s the thrill of the race, <br>
Hotfix fire, setting the pace. <br>
